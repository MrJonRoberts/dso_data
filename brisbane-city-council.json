Ceramics have stored our most precious resources, have been vehicles for knowledge and traditions, and passed between generations as heirlooms.<br /><br />Clay: Collected Ceramics is a celebration of ceramics combining works from Museum of Brisbane&#8217;s Collection and Kylie Johnson&#8217;s personal collection. It is accompanied by Commune, a display of single pieces contributed by more than 300 makers responding to MoB&#8217;s largest community callout to date.<br /><br />With pieces spanning 60 years of creativity, including fresh works never before displayed, Clay sparks a conversation about the relationship between potters and their visions. From functional wares of the 1970s to conceptual creations by iconoclastic makers of today, this exhibition will speak of the meaningful processes of making and collecting.<br /><br />The many highlights of Clay include&#8239;a bold grouping selected from the MoB Collection to represent the many shades of brown, featuring works by ten renowned makers including Carl McConnell, Gwyn Hanssen Pigott, Milton Moon, Lyndal Moor and Kevin Grealy. In stunning contrast are newly commissioned and acquired pieces by diverse contemporary makers Bonnie Hislop, Nicolette Johnson, Jane du Rand, Kenji Uranishi and Steph Woods. Flowing throughout is an evolving performative installation by Artist in Residence Jody Rallah. A generous array of objects gleaned from years of collecting speaks of the life of Kylie Johnson, author, poet, traveller and founder of Brisbane treasure-trove, paper boat press. A film commissioned for the exhibition insinuates the viewer into intimate spaces of ceramics themselves.

The Museum sought to create a temporary, site-specific and large-scale collection showcasing the diversity and vigour of current Brisbane ceramic practice. <br /><br />The idea of a &#8216;memory vessel&#8217; is that it is resonant of place for its maker. Participants were urged to interpret the idea as they wished. Their vessel might be a literal representation of a place, embellished with its trees, rocks, clouds or colours; or it might hold in its material a thought or feeling, meditated upon during its creation. The only rules were that the vessel had to be original, to conform to size restraints, and to have been fired. <br /><br />It is widely felt that the practice of making ceramics has exploded across the globe over the past decade. Some of the makers featured in &#39;Commune&#39; have been working with clay for decades; some for a comparatively short time. Many wrote informative, sometimes moving and inspiring statements to accompany their ceramic pieces. Taken together, their tributes to their vessels indicate that squishy, messy clay must be humanity&#8217;s most-loved medium. It is clear that for many, having cool clay in hand is healing, grounding and exciting, filling the maker with feelings of peace, purpose and possibility all at once. <br /><br />&#39;Commune&#39;, is the community&#8217;s contribution to MoB&#8217;s &#39;Clay: Collected Ceramics&#39;, a cross-section of cultural production and a joyful celebration of the Brisbane ceramics community, here and now.","locationType":"In-Person","location":"Museum of Brisbane, Brisbane City","webLink":"<a href=\"https://www.museumofbrisbane.com.au/whats-on/commune/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"https://www.museumofbrisbane.com.au/whats-on/commune/\">www.museumofbrisbane.com.au&#8230;</a>","startDateTime":"2023-09-04T10:00:00","endDateTime":"2023-09-04T17:00:00","dateTimeFormatted":"Monday, September 4, 2023, 10am&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;5pm&nbsp;EAST","allDay":false,"startTimeZoneOffset":"+1000","endTimeZoneOffset":"+1000","canceled":false,"openSignUp":false,"reservationFull":false,"pastDeadline":false,"pastCancelDeadline":false,"requiresPayment":false,"refundsAllowed":false,"waitingListAvailable":false,"repeatingRegistration":0,"repeats":"Every day through October 22, 2023","seriesID":166901755,"eventImage":{"url":"https://www.trumba.com/i/DgBLJYek7PivEB8e8Aptsi81.jpg","size":{"width":1290,"height":775}},"detailImage":{"url":"https://www.trumba.com/i/DgBLJYek7PivEB8e8Aptsi81.jpg","size":{"width":1290,"height":775}},"customFields":[{"fieldID":22503,"label":"Venue","value":"Museum of Brisbane, Brisbane City","type":17},{"fieldID":22505,"label":"Venue address","value":"<a href=\"http://maps.google.com/?q=-27.4693454,153.0216909(Museum+of+Brisbane%2c+Brisbane+City)\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Museum of Brisbane, Brisbane City Hall, 64 Adelaide Street, Brisbane City</a>","type":9},{"fieldID":21859,"label":"Event type","value":"Art, Exhibitions, Free","type":17},{"fieldID":22177,"label":"Cost","value":"Free","type":0},{"fieldID":23562,"label":"Age","value":"All ages.","type":0},{"fieldID":22732,"label":"Bookings","value":"No booking required.","type":1},{"fieldID":51540,"label":"Bookings required","value":"No","type":3}],"permaLinkUrl":"https://www.brisbane.qld.gov.au/trumba?trumbaEmbed=view%3devent%26eventid%3d166901870","eventActionUrl":"https://eventactions.com/eventactions/brisbane-city-council#/actions/8cy16f4efzp417vgub878tf02v","categoryCalendar":"Brisbane's calendar|Creative events","registrationTransferTargetCount":0,"regAllowChanges":true},{"eventID":167813474,"template":"Brisbane City Council","title":"Patterns for Future Living","description":"Patterns for Future Living brings together DIY (do-it-yourself) aesthetics with a DIT (do-it-together) ethos by Rae Haynes.<br /><br />Engage, contemplate and discover an expansive interconnected future with Patterns for Future Living, a dynamic DIY exhibition that stirs collective action for environmental and ecological justice.<br /><br />Inspired by the works of modernist artist Sonia Delaunay Terk, this space fosters mediation and care through an immersive installation of rhythmic colour, pattern and sound.<br /><br />Commissioned by Metro Arts and Brisbane Festival, this visionary body of work explores future living patterns, underscoring the interconnectedness of all living things.<br /><br />Free workshops:<br /><br />Scores for Future Living |Saturday 9 September<br />Rae Haynes will host an experimental workshop centred around the artist&#8217;s archive of environmental protest slogans.

Ceramics have stored our most precious resources, have been vehicles for knowledge and traditions, and passed between generations as heirlooms.<br /><br />Clay: Collected Ceramics is a celebration of ceramics combining works from Museum of Brisbane&#8217;s Collection and Kylie Johnson&#8217;s personal collection. It is accompanied by Commune, a display of single pieces contributed by more than 300 makers responding to MoB&#8217;s largest community callout to date.<br /><br />With pieces spanning 60 years of creativity, including fresh works never before displayed, Clay sparks a conversation about the relationship between potters and their visions. From functional wares of the 1970s to conceptual creations by iconoclastic makers of today, this exhibition will speak of the meaningful processes of making and collecting.<br /><br />The many highlights of Clay include&#8239;a bold grouping selected from the MoB Collection to represent the many shades of brown, featuring works by ten renowned makers including Carl McConnell, Gwyn Hanssen Pigott, Milton Moon, Lyndal Moor and Kevin Grealy. In stunning contrast are newly commissioned and acquired pieces by diverse contemporary makers Bonnie Hislop, Nicolette Johnson, Jane du Rand, Kenji Uranishi and Steph Woods. Flowing throughout is an evolving performative installation by Artist in Residence Jody Rallah. A generous array of objects gleaned from years of collecting speaks of the life of Kylie Johnson, author, poet, traveller and founder of Brisbane treasure-trove, paper boat press. A film commissioned for the exhibition insinuates the viewer into intimate spaces of ceramics themselves. Woven throughout are many makers&#8217; ruminations on how they lost their hearts to this most elementary, seductive material.<br /><br />Slip into an exhibition that turns the wheel on how we perceive Clay.<br /><br />Museum of Brisbane is Brisbane City Council&#39;s leading history and art museum, where you can experience our city&#39;s vibrant culture.&#160;","locationType":"In-Person","location":"Museum of Brisbane, Brisbane City","webLink":"<a href=\"https://www.museumofbrisbane.com.au/whats-on/clay-collected-ceramics/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"https://www.museumofbrisbane.com.au/whats-on/clay-collected-ceramics/\">www.museumofbrisbane.com.au&#8230;</a>","startDateTime":"2023-09-05T10:00:00","endDateTime":"2023-09-05T17:00:00","dateTimeFormatted":"Tuesday, September 5, 2023, 10am&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;5pm&nbsp;EAST","allDay":false,"startTimeZoneOffset":"+1000","endTimeZoneOffset":"+1000","canceled":false,"openSignUp":false,"reservationFull":false,"pastDeadline":false,"pastCancelDeadline":false,"requiresPayment":false,"refundsAllowed":false,"waitingListAvailable":false,"repeatingRegistration":0,"repeats":"Every day through October 22, 2023","seriesID":166854302,"eventImage":{"url":"https://www.trumba.com/i/DgCdKAL0IC9DHmnzdkiMzsSZ.jpg","size":{"width":1290,"height":775}},"detailImage":{"url":"https://www.trumba.com/i/DgCdKAL0IC9DHmnzdkiMzsSZ.jpg","size":{"width":1290,"height":775}},"customFields":[{"fieldID":22503,"label":"Venue","value":"Museum of Brisbane, Brisbane City","type":17},{"fieldID":22505,"label":"Venue address","value":"<a href=\"http://maps.google.com/?q=-27.4693454,153.0216909(Museum+of+Brisbane%2c+Brisbane+City)\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Museum of Brisbane, Brisbane City Hall, 64 Adelaide Street, Brisbane City</a>","type":9},{"fieldID":21859,"label":"Event type","value":"Art, Creative, Exhibitions, Free, Tours","type":17},{"fieldID":22177,"label":"Cost","value":"Free","type":0},{"fieldID":23562,"label":"Age","value":"All ages.","type":0},{"fieldID":22732,"label":"Bookings","value":"No bookings required.","type":1},{"fieldID":51540,"label":"Bookings required","value":"No","type":3}],"permaLinkUrl":"https://www.brisbane.qld.gov.au/trumba?trumbaEmbed=view%3devent%26eventid%3d166854418","eventActionUrl":"https://eventactions.com/eventactions/brisbane-city-council#/actions/4h98m2kvc3kgaj18zh4hgzrvk2","categoryCalendar":"Brisbane's calendar|Creative events","registrationTransferTargetCount":0,"regAllowChanges":true},{"eventID":166901871,"template":"Brisbane City Council","title":"Commune","description":"Late in 2022, Museum of Brisbane invited people working in ceramics in the Greater Brisbane Region to submit an original &#8216;memory vessel&#8217; for exhibition during &#39;Clay: Collected Ceramics&#39; and BRISBANE ART DESIGN (BAD). The Museum sought to create a temporary, site-specific and large-scale collection showcasing the diversity and vigour of current Brisbane ceramic practice. <br /><br />The idea of a &#8216;memory vessel&#8217; is that it is resonant of place for its maker. Participants were urged to interpret the idea as they wished. Their vessel might be a literal representation of a place, embellished with its trees, rocks, clouds or colours; or it might hold in its material a thought or feeling, meditated upon during its creation. The only rules were that the vessel had to be original, to conform to size restraints, and to have been fired. <br /><br />It is widely felt that the practice of making ceramics has exploded across the globe over the past decade. Some of the makers featured in &#39;Commune&#39; have been working with clay for decades; some for a comparatively short time.
